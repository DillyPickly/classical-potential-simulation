# classical-potential-simulation
A simple python simulator

In classical physics, the EOM of a system can be determined from the potential in the system.
Here, I will investigate a discrete particle simulation

The project consists of three main python files.
  - config.py 
  - driver.py 
  - visualize.py
  
  **config.py**: holds all the configuration information for the project.
  
  **driver.py**: computes the particle dynamics and saves them to a file.
  
  **visualize.py**: creates animations to view the simulations.
